# Excel-and-Tableau-Dashboard-For-Wealth-of-Nations-Dataset
# 🌍 Wealth of Nations Data Analysis Project

## Overview 
This project leverages the Wealth of Nations dataset to analyze various socio-economic indicators across different countries. The workflow involves data cleaning, filtering, sorting, and visualization using both Excel and Tableau to derive meaningful insights.

## Tools Used
- 🗃 **Microsoft Excel**: For data cleaning, filtering, sorting, chart creation, and file protection.
- 📊 **Tableau**: For creating interactive dashboards and advanced visualizations.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the Wealth of Nations dataset, encompassing various socio-economic indicators such as GDP, life expectancy, and smartphone usage across multiple countries.

## Excel Analysis
In Excel, the following tasks were performed:
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning**: Removed inconsistencies and formatted the dataset.
- 🔍 **Filtering and Sorting**: Applied filters and sorted data to focus on specific aspects.
- 📈 **Chart Creation**: Created visualizations to represent key insights.
- 🔒 **File Protection**: Implemented measures to secure the Excel file.

## Tableau Dashboard
After preprocessing in Excel, the dataset was imported into Tableau for advanced visualization. The Tableau dashboard includes four key visuals:
1. 🗺️ **Top 20 Countries by GDP per Capita (Map)**: A map highlighting the top 20 countries based on GDP per capita.
2. 💬 **Top 20 Countries by GDP per Capita (Bubble Chart)**: A bubble chart showcasing the top 20 countries based on GDP per capita.
3. 📊 **Top 20 Life Expectancy by Country**: A bar chart illustrating the top 20 countries by life expectancy.
4. ⚖️ **GDP vs. Life Expectancy**: A scatter plot depicting the relationship between GDP and life expectancy across countries.
