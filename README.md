# Wealth of Nations Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing data from the Wealth of Nations dataset, exploring various socio-economic indicators across different countries. The analysis involves data cleaning, filtering, sorting, and visualizing the data using Excel and Tableau to gain meaningful insights.

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**: Utilized for initial data cleaning, filtering, sorting, chart creation, and file protection.
- **Tableau**: Employed for creating interactive dashboards to visualize the dataset comprehensively.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Wealth of Nations dataset, which contains various socio-economic indicators such as GDP, life expectancy, and smartphone usage across multiple countries.

## Excel Analysis
In the Excel phase of the project, the following tasks were performed:
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed inconsistencies and formatted the dataset.
- **Filtering and Sorting**: Applied filters and sorted data to focus on specific aspects.
- **Charts Creation**: Created visualizations to represent key insights from the data.
- **File Protection**: Implemented measures to protect the integrity and security of the Excel file.

## Tableau Dashboard
After preprocessing the data in Excel, it was imported into Tableau for advanced visualization. The Tableau dashboard consists of four key visuals:
1. **Top 20 Countries by GDP per Capita (Map)**: A map highlighting the top 20 countries based on GDP per capita.
2. **Top 20 Countries by GDP per Capita (Bubble Chart)**: A bubble chart showcasing the top 20 countries based on GDP per capita.
3. **Top 20 Life Expectancy by Country**: A bar chart illustrating the top 20 countries by life expectancy.
4. **GDP vs. Life Expectancy**: A scatter plot depicting the relationship between GDP and life expectancy across countries.

## Conclusion
This project provides insights into the socio-economic landscape of various nations through data analysis and visualization techniques. By leveraging the capabilities of Excel and Tableau, the project delivers a comprehensive exploration and presentation of the dataset, offering valuable insights for further research and decision-making.
