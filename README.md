# Excel-and-Tableau-Dashboard-For-Wealth-of-Nations-Dataset
# Wealth of Nations Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing data from the Wealth of Nations dataset, exploring various socio-economic indicators across different countries. The analysis primarily involves cleaning, filtering, sorting, and visualizing the data to gain insights into trends and patterns.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel: Used for data cleaning, filtering, sorting, and initial visualization.
- Tableau: Utilized for creating interactive dashboards and further visualizing the dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Wealth of Nations dataset, which contains various socio-economic indicators for multiple countries.

## Excel Analysis
In the Excel phase of the project, I performed the following tasks:
- Cleaned and formatted the dataset for analysis.
- Applied filters and sorted the data to focus on specific aspects.
- Created visualizations and charts to represent the insights gained from the data.
- Implemented protection measures to secure the Excel file.

## Tableau Dashboard
After preprocessing the data in Excel, I imported it into Tableau and developed a dashboard consisting of four key visuals:
1. GDP vs. Smartphone Users: A scatter plot depicting the relationship between a country's GDP and the number of smartphone users.
2. Life Expectancy at Birth: A bar chart illustrating the average life expectancy at birth across different countries.
3. Smartphone Users: A line chart showcasing the trend in the number of smartphone users over time.
4. [Insert fourth visual here]

## Conclusion
Through this project, I aimed to uncover insights into the socio-economic landscape of various nations using data analysis and visualization techniques. The combination of Excel and Tableau allowed for comprehensive exploration and presentation of the dataset, offering valuable insights for further research and decision-making.
